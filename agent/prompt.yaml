  Example Task:
  "I have severe migraine headaches and nausea, living in Paris"

  Thought: First, I'll analyze the symptoms to identify potential conditions and required specialists.
  Code:
  ```python
  symptoms = "severe migraine headaches and nausea"
  patient_info = {
      "symptoms": symptoms,
      "severity": "severe"
  }
  
  analysis = analyze_symptoms(symptoms=symptoms, patient_info=patient_info)
  print(analysis)
  ```<end_code>
  Observation: Symptoms suggest migraine condition, recommended specialists: neurologist, headache specialist

  Thought: Now I'll search for available specialists in Paris.
  Code:
  ```python
  location = {
      "city": "Paris",
      "country": "France"
  }
  
  doctors = search_doctors(
      specialty="neurologist",
      location=location,
      timeframe="next_7_days"
  )
  print(doctors)
  ```<end_code>
